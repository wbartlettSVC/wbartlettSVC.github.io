					<h2>Q: What should I first focus on when starting a new character?</h2>
					<p>A: While this is debatable, the most important thing to find is a weapon. Whether this means using a weapon your character starts with, making a makeshift crowbar, or finding a gun in a nearby gun store, protecting yourself is the first thing you need to focus on. Easily the next, however, is securing a good temporary base of operations. This could be anything from a house on the outskirts of a town or city, a farmhouse, an abandoned cabin in the woods, or any of the starting shelters. Fortify it, make sure there are no creatures or zombies nearby to come after you, and start collecting a stockpile of non-perishable food and drink.</p>

					<h2>Q: This game is so confusing...How do I learn how to do any of it?</h2>
					<p>A: Cataclysm is a game that relies almost entirely on keyboard keys to work. You can find the keybindings in your options menu, or by pushing the "?" on earlier builds of the game. The most important keys to remember are the arrow keys for movement and attacking creatures in the direction you are moving, "e" to examine or use objects in the world, Tab or "f" to hit creatures nearby or shoot a gun or ranged weapon you are using, and "i" to open your inventory. "Esc" is the button to open your menu. You can find a list of the move important keys <a href="http://cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Controls">here</a>.</p>

					<h2>Q: Am I hurt? Happy, sad? How do I know?</h2>
					<p>A: You can find a lot of information about your character, from their stats to their skill leves to their current aflictions and mutations, by pushing the "@" key. Pushing the "v" opens the morale screen, allowing you to see what your character is enjoying or hating. Morale can effect if your character will do certain tasks, so you had should do your best to keep it high. </p>
